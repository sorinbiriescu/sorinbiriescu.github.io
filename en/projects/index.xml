      <description>Call analyzer and manpower estimator This is based on one of my previous analyses for my clients. The situation is as follows: my client has an IT support department which receives telephone calls for support request. The team providing support is limited due to budget constraints and needs to do also onsite support as well as the aforementioned remote support.
My client wants to know how many persons should be available to pickup telephone calls in certain periods (hour interval, days of the week, month) in order to properly assign the technicians to either provide remote support when needed or go onsite.</description>
